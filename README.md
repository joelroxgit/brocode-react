# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

//node_modules have external libraries 
public have images html files 
src folder 

main.js is the mainn file where the render happens.

returning a single jsx file is valid

to add javascript variable and function to the react inside return we need to use {}. where as in top of return it is not needed
